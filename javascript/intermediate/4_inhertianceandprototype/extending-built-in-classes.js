1.Built-in classes like Array, Map and others are extendable also
2.But No static inheritance in built-ins.
Normally, when one class extends another, both static and non-static methods are inherited. That was thoroughly explained in the article Static properties and methods.

But built-in classes are an exception. They donâ€™t inherit statics from each other.
