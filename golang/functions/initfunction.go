// Declaration of the main package
package main

/*

init() function is just like the main function, does not take any
argument nor return anything. This function is present in every package
and this function is called when the package is initialized.
This function is declared implicitly, so you cannot reference it
from anywhere and you are allowed to create multiple init() function in
the same program and they execute in the order they are created.
You are allowed to create init() function anywhere in the program and
they are called in lexical file name order (Alphabetical Order).
And allowed to put statements if the init() function, but
always remember to init() function is executed before the main()
function call, so it does not depend to main() function.
The main purpose of the init() function is to initialize the global
variables that cannot be initialized in the global context.
